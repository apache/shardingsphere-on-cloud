                    description: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate
                      gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration
                      in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a
                      termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly
                      halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected
                      cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's
                      terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must
                      be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately
                      via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a
                      beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod
                      feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds
                      is used if unset.
